### my playground for diffusion models

This includes sandbox code and my experiments on image gen models.

Now, I know I have other diffusion specific repos, but i will start stuff here, then decouple them to separate repos.

I do my testing on flower images. 
- Diffusion...image gen models are soooo frastrating to implement/train.
sometimes, you can't find the bug, and it's also slow. 

- DiTs are slow to train, but are better than U-Nets with more data/scaling.

- I wanna try some less-intensive stuff. Most of my research will not involve pretraining models from scratch, but a bit more of... **model bending**.
